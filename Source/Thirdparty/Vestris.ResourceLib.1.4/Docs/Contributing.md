Setting Up a Development Environment

Building the Project
--------------------

You can build all C# source code in Visual Studio. To build the entire project, use MSBuild from command line and type `build all`. This builds both Debug and Release .NET binaries as well as a final `.zip` package with all artifacts. 

``` dos
c:\source\resourcelib> build all
```

A `Vestris.ResourceLib.zip` package is created in the `target` directory.
